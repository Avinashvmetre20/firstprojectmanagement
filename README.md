# firstprojectmanagement
First created a repo of firstprojectmanegment by clicking on new repo.
After that go to issues and click on milestones.
added "core module dvolopment completion" milestone, discription and due date 
after that added some issues in issues section tab with label and assignee then settledup the project board and created the project with todo, in progress, Done columns. added five issues to todo column moved the issues after complition of work.
linked the issues to milestones to core module development completion milestone because of 1. the feature request(user authentication module) is a key functionality for core modules. 2. the task(unit task) ensure the modules reliabilty, directly contributing to the milestone goal.
finally written reflection.md file
